My name is Ko Cusveller, student at Codaisseur.

This app is a tool to help companies brainstorm new ideas for projects, and help visualize and organize their work. It is still very much WIP, but if you want to take a sneak peek, you can do so here:

My goal in this app is to create a minimalistic, user friendly design where team members on the same project can interactively move their ideas and thoughts around, as if it was a real life mood board. I call this the Sand Boad. The project manager however will have the authority to close the idea gathering part of the board when the time is right, and move the relevant ideas or references to the next phase, called the Glass board. 
Here the ideas and references will be organised by theme or topic, and team members can give their feedback on every item, and re-order them if they so desire. After this, the project manager again has the option to close down the comments and re-ordering, and move the relevant items to the next board, the Diamond Board.
The Diamond Board is intended to provide clear structure and goals where people can select their favorite topic and comments, and claim it as their action. If by chance a topic is not chosen by any team member, the project manager can chose assign a member to said topic.

What I'm trying to accomplish, is a smooth flow from free-wheeling brainstorm, to hard agreements with a minimalistic and intuitive presentation. I will attempt this by using a lot of white space, sparse texts and menu's and a smooth dragging-and-dropping of elements.
These are some of the tools I used: Javscript, React, Framer Motion, Sequelize, Express, Node.js
